We employ queries to evaluate the robot's performance on different *cutting* tasks.
These queries demonstrate how the robot dynamically adapts its task or behaviour based on acquired knowledge.
We utilise the PR2 Robot as the robotic platform for our experiments in a simulated environment called [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3).
Since this environment does not support actions like peeling or core removal from a physical perspective, we focus on simulating queries that demonstrate how the general task mentioned above can be parameterised using the gathered **[web knowledge](https://food-ninja.github.io/food-cutting-website/knowledge.html)** from our knowledge graph.

In this figure, you can see three different parameterisations for the same generalised plan:
The left picture shows the default implementation for *cutting*, where a single slice at the end of the cucumber is cut off.
In the middle, the task variation *slicing* is executed. Here, multiple cuts beginning at the end of the cucumber are performed to create multiple slices with similar length.
On the right, the task variation *halving* is shown. For this task, a single cut in the middle of the cucumber is done.
