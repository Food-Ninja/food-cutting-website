# Architecture

To achieve our goal of enabling the robotic agent to handle unkown task variations by parameterising general action plans using web knowledge, we employ the following architecture:

</p>

In general, the robot needs to have access to a general action designator of cutting that can be parameterised.
When the robot is given a task request, it can either query the graph database with the knowledge graph directly via its SPARQL REST API or use a knowledge framework with additional functionalities such as the KnowRob knowledge processing system[^1] and pose Prolog queries, which then are translated to SPARQL queries.
More information on the different ways of querying the knowledge graph can be found **[here](https://food-ninja.github.io/FoodCutting/OntologyQuery.html)**.

We use [PyCRAM](https://pycram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the robot's cognitive architecture.
It is the Python3 implementation of the [CRAM](https://cram-system.org/) cognitive architecture[^2] and expresses its programs as symbolic plans (so called *designators*) outlining the robot's behaviour.
During execution, a *designator resolver* is used to refine the generalised instructions into specific instructions the robot can follow.
One way of resolving a designator includes querying the knowledge graph to gather concrete values for abstract parameters based on the current environment, object composition and task to execute.
