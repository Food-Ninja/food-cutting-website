To support robotic agents in executing variations of <i>Cutting</i> on different <i>fruits and vegetables</i>, we collect two types of knowledge in our knowledge graph: <b>action</b> and <b>object knowledge</b>.
Both kinds of knowledge need to be linked to enable task execution.
Afterwards, the knowledge can be queried using e.g. SPARQL or Prolog.
