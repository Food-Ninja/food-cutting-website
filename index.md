**ANNOUNCEMENT**
We present our work in a **Tutorial on Contextualizing and Executing Robot Manipulation Plans Using Web Knowledge** at [ESWC24](https://2024.eswc-conferences.org/) and [HHAI24](https://hhai-conference.org/2024/).
More information can be found on the corresponding [Website](https://kr3-workshop.net/).



This project deals with the challenge of enabling robots to learn everyday manipulation tasks in the household domain.
This challenge is important for robots that can perform a wide breadth of manipulation tasks and task variations, that can be performed by various robots using various tools for a variety of purposes.
The focus of this work lies on the task of *Cutting Food*, especially fruits and vegetables:
