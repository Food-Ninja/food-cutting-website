We want to enable robots to learn everyday manipulation tasks from the Web and thus make abstract knowledge <b>actionable<\b>.

This challenge is important for robots that can perform a wide breadth of manipulation tasks and task variations, that can be performed by various robots using various tools for a variety of purposes.

For a robot to successfully perform such a breadth of maniulation actions, it needs to <b>understand<\b> given tasks. We show how robots can use a knowledge graph to understand a given task by answering questions such as:
- "What is the result state when performing a specific action?"
- "What object can be used to perform a given task?" "Is there a preferred object to use for this task?"
- "Can the task be performed on a given object?" etc.
	
We start tackling this challenge by focusing on selected task domains, starting with cutting. 
The idea is that our methodology can teach robots to cut any fruit with any tool for any purpose.
For this, the robot needs to query the knowledge graph to parameterise its general action plan.
